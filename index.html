    <b><u>Hobbies and interests :</u></b>

</h4>

<ul>
    <li><b>Travelling :</b> I have always had multiple reasons to travel and I've always loved it.
    I have family all over the western hemisphere, and friends in multiple countries as well.
    I love skiing and I love the sea so those are two other reasons to travel. I also like trying
    new foods and drinks wherever I go. All these reasons have made me visit over 20 countries in my
    life in 3 continents</li>
    <br />
    <li><b>Music :</b> I like listening to music just like everyone else. However I also love playing 
    the piano. I started when I was 8 years olld and have kept playing since. I went to music 
    school as long as I was in school, but I've kept playing for myself ever since I left music school.</li>
    <br />
    <li><b>Sports/Games/Videogames :</b></li> I love all three of those, I've played several sports
    in my childhood getting to the point of playing basketball on a regional level in Spain.
    I love any kind of competitive environment where there is a winner and a loser. My lifelong experience
    in sports games and video-games has taught me several values that can be used in a work 
    environment such as teamwork skills, thriving and keeping calm under pressure, commitment,
    learning how to accept situations in life, etc.
    <br />
    <li><b>Socializing :</b></li> I love going out for drinks, coffee, or for dinner and enjoy the 
    company of other people.
