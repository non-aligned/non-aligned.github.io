		My name is Marko Vukic, I am an avid traveler, having lived in 4 different countries and traveled to more than 20.
		I like playing the piano , playing basketball , computer games, and socializing with friends and family.<br /><br />
		If you want to know what makes you crazy in each of those things , well I can tell you:<br /><br />
		-In piano, trying to learn Liszt's Hungarian Rhapsody #2 is the fastest way to be declared insane.<br /><br />
		-The same could be said about EU4 (Europa Universalis 4) players. That is a Grand Strategy game
		that has amateurs playing it as many hours as a school year lasts.<br /><br />
		-When playing basketball, it's all about moving around the ball as a team. It drives the rivals mad.<br /><br />
		-When you go out , there is no secret. Bad alcohol and mixing will ruin anybody. That's why I prefer
		having Rhum and Cokes as long as I'm partying, preferably with Rhum I know. That way I can have fun,
		enjoy my drinks , and not get wasted.<br /><br /><br />
